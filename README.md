Project:PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Overview of Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression
Objective:
To implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables, and to evaluate its performance. This includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model, evaluating its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²), and visualizing the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.

Key Activities:
Data Generation:

Generate synthetic data with one feature and one target variable for simplicity and clarity.

Dataset Preparation:

Convert the generated data into a pandas DataFrame.

Define the feature matrix X and the target vector y.

Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split ratio.

Model Training:

Instantiate and train a Linear Regression model using the training data.

Model Prediction:

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

Model Evaluation:

Calculate and print evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

Visualization:

Create scatter plots to visualize actual vs. predicted values.

Plot the regression line to assess the model's accuracy visually.

Technologies Used:
Numpy: For numerical operations and generating synthetic data.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.

Scikit-learn: For model training, evaluation, and data splitting.

By following these steps, the project effectively demonstrates how to implement and evaluate a simple linear regression model, providing insights into its performance and accuracy through visualizations and statistical metrics. This process can be applied to various datasets with continuous target variables for predictive modeling tasks.![Screenshot 2025-01-10 221421](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5e6047e-f67c-4e19-8b31-9baf4beb5a7e)
